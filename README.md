Making a swagger thing

## Why

This project is just me playing around with two services

1. The first is a simple JSON API and that also has a docs route that serves a JSON swagger spec
2. The second is a server that serves the swagger-ui client

Hopefully, I can hit the second and get it to generate a report for the first.

The notes on how to run each of these projects will be in a Markdown in each of their respective directories.
